# For and While Loops

# While Loop
x = 0
while x < 4:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

# Expected output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3


# For Loop - also called iterators
for x in range(1, 7):
    print(x)

# Expected output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6


# For Loop for String
Months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "April", "May", "June"]
for m in Months:
    print(m)

# Expected output:
# Jan
# Feb
# Mar
# April
# May
# June


# Break Statements in For Loop
# use the break statement - allows you to break or terminate the execution of the for loop
for x in range(10, 20):
    if x == 15:
        break
    print(x)

# Expected output:
# 10
# 11
# 12
# 13
# 14

# use the continue statement - will terminate the current iteration of the for loop
# BUT will continue execution of the remaining iterations.
for x in range(10, 20):
    if x % 5 == 0:
        continue
    print(x)

# Expected output:
# 11
# 12
# 13
# 14
# 16
# 17
# 18
# 19


# Enumerate() - used for the numbering or indexing the members in the list
Months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "April", "May", "June"]
for i, m in enumerate(Months):
    print(i, m)

# Expected output:
# 0 Jan
# 1 Feb
# 2 Mar
# 3 April
# 4 May
# 5 June


# Use For Loop to Repeat the Same Statement
for i in '123':
    print("sunshine", i)

# Expected output:
# sunshine 1
# sunshine 2
# sunshine 3

# File Handling - Create, Open, Append, Read, Write

# File modes
# ‘r’	This is the default mode. It Opens file for reading.
# ‘w’	This Mode Opens file for writing. If file does not exist, it creates a new file. If file exists it truncates the file.
# ‘x’	Creates a new file. If file already exists, the operation fails.
# ‘a’	Open file in append mode. If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
# ‘t’	This is the default mode. It opens in text mode.
# ‘b’	This opens in binary mode.
# ‘+’	This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)


# How to Open a Text File in Python
file_object = open("filename", "mode")

# How to Create a Text File in Python

# Step 1) Open the .txt file
f = open("example.txt", "w+")

# Step 2) Enter data into the file
for i in range(10):  # for loop iterates 10 times
    f.write("This is line %d\r\n" % (i+1))

# Step 3) Close the file instance
f.close()

# Expected output in text file:
# This is line 1
#
# This is line 2
#
# This is line 3
#
# This is line 4
#
# This is line 5
#
# This is line 6
#
# This is line 7
#
# This is line 8
#
# This is line 9
#
# This is line 10


# How to Append Text File in Python

# Step 1)
f = open("example.txt", "a+")

# Step 2)
for i in range(2):
    f.write("Appended line %d\r\n" % (i+1))  # Will append to the bottom of the text file

# Expected output in text file:
# This is line 1
#
# This is line 2
#
# This is line 3
#
# This is line 4
#
# This is line 5
#
# This is line 6
#
# This is line 7
#
# This is line 8
#
# This is line 9
#
# This is line 10
#
# Appended line 1
#
# Appended line 2


# How to Read Files in Python

# Step 1) Open the file in Read mode
f = open("example.txt", "r")

# Step 2) Use the mode function in the code to check that the file is in open mode.
if f.mode == 'r':
    contents = f.read()  # If file is in r (read mode) it will print the content of the text file

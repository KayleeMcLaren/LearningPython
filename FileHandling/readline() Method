# readline() Method - helps to read one complete line from the given file.
# It has a trailing newline (“\n”) at the end of the string returned.

# Step 1) - First, open the file using the file open() method
myfile = open("demo.txt", "r")

# Step 2) - Use the readline() method to read the line from the file demo.txt
myline = myfile.readline()

# Step 3) - The line read is stored inside myline. Print the line to see the details
print(myline)

# Step 4) - Once the reading is done, close the file using close() method
myfile.close()


# Using size argument in readline()
# You can also make use of the size parameter to get only the required length of the line
myfile = open("demo.txt", "r")
myline = myfile.readline(10)  # has the size parameter 10
print(myline)  # The first line will be fetched, and it will return the line with characters from 0 to 10.
myfile.close()


# Read a File Line-by-Line
# The readline() method helps to read just one line at a time, and it returns the first line from the file given.
# Here, we will make use of readline() to read all the lines from the file given.
# Using readline() inside while-loop will take care of reading all the lines present

myfile = open("demo.txt", "r")
myline = myfile.readline()
while myline:
    print(myline)
    myline = myfile.readline()
myfile.close()

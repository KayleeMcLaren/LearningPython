# Functions Basics
# A function is a piece of code which runs when it is referenced

# define a function using “def” statement followed by the function name and parentheses ( )
def func1():
    # Python functions don’t have any explicit begin or end like curly braces to indicate the start
    # and stop for the function, they have to rely on this indentation
    print("I am learning Python functions")
    print("still in func1")

func1()

def square(x):  # The argument is a value that is passed to the function when it’s called
    return x * x  # Return command in Python specifies what value to give back to the caller of the function

print(square(4))

def multiply(x, y=0):
    print("value of x=", x)
    print("value of y=", y)

    return x * y

print(multiply(y=2, x=4))


# Expected output
# I am learning Python functions
# still in func1
# 16
# value of x= 4
# value of y= 2
# 8

# Arithmetic Operators - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, %modulus, exponent, etc
x = 4
y = 5
print(x + y)

# Expected output:
# 9


# Comparison Operators - compares the values on either side of the operand and determines the relation between them
x = 4
y = 5
print(('x > y  is', x > y))

# Expected output:
# ('x > y  is', False)


# Assignment Operators - used for assigning the value of the right operand to the left operand
num1 = 4
num2 = 5
print(("Line 1 - Value of num1 : ", num1))
print(("Line 2 - Value of num2 : ", num2))

# Expected output:
# ('Line 1 - Value of num1 : ', 4)
# ('Line 2 - Value of num2 : ', 5)


# Compound Assignment Operator - consist of a binary operator and the simple assignment operator
num1 = 4
num2 = 5
res = num1 + num2
res += num1
print(("Line 1 - Result of + is ", res))

# Expected output:
# ('Line 1 - Result of + is ', 13)


# Not Equal Operator
A = 44
B = 284
C = 284
print(B != A)
print(B != C)

# Expected output:
# True
# False


# Logical Operators - used for conditional statements are true or false
a = True
b = False
print(('a and b is', a and b))
print(('a or b is', a or b))
print(('not a is', not a))

# Expected output:
# ('a and b is', False)
# ('a or b is', True)
# ('not a is', False)


# Membership Operators - test for membership in a sequence such as lists, strings or tuples
x = 4
y = 8
numList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if x in numList:
    print("Line 1 - x is available in the given list")
else:
    print("Line 1 - x is not available in the given list")
if y not in numList:
    print("Line 2 - y is not available in the given list")
else:
    print("Line 2 - y is available in the given list")

# Identity Operators - compare the memory location of two objects
x = 20
y = 20
if x is y:
    print("x & y  SAME identity")
y = 30
if x is not y:
    print("x & y have DIFFERENT identity")

# Expected output:
# Line 1 - x is available in the given list
# Line 2 - y is not available in the given list


# Operator precedence - determines which operators need to be evaluated first
v = 4
w = 5
x = 8
y = 2
z = 0
z = (v+w) * x / y
print("Value of (v+w) * x/ y is ",  z)

# Expected output:
# Value of (v+w) * x/ y is  36.0


# Not Equal Operator with IF Statement
X = 5
Y = 5
if X != Y:
    print("X is not equal to Y")
else:
    print("X is equal to Y")

# Expected output:
# X is equal to Y


# Equal to (==) Operator with While Loop
m = 300
while m <= 305:
    m = m + 1
    if m % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(m)

# Expected output:
# 301
# 303
# 305


# Finding Even Numbers by Using Not Equal Operator
m = 300
while m <= 305:
    m = m + 1
    if m % 2 != 0:
        continue
print(m)

# Expected output:
# 302
